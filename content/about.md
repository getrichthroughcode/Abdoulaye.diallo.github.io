Hello! I'm **Abdoulaye Diallo**, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for coding, data science, and artificial intelligence. I have a strong background in computer science and a deep interest in building intelligent systems that can learn and adapt.


I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering (MEng) in Electronics, with a specialization in Signal Processing and Computer Vision, at the Bordeaux Institute of Technology. I am set to graduate in September 2025. 

Before my current studies, I completed a rigorous three-year intensive program in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, designed to prepare students for the nationwide competitive entrance exams to top French graduate schools of engineering. This program provided me with a solid foundation in advanced mathematics, physics, and the fundamental theories of computer science, including key topics like graph theory and algorithms.


## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++,Go, HDL
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn,JAX
- **Data Science Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS(S3, ECR, Lambda), Google Cloud

## Interests

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about the latest trends in AI, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. I also have a keen interest in teaching and sharing knowledge with others through blogging and tutorials.
