# VanillaHR Internship Experience

## **Project Overview** 
**Duration**: 05/13/2024 - 09/30/2024

During my internship at VanillaHR, I was tasked with designing and deploying an innovative **CV parsing solution**. This project aimed to enhance the recruitment process by employing AI for efficient extraction and analysis of candidate information.

## **Responsibilities and Contribution** 
- **Developed** an AI-based CV parsing model to extract relevant information from resumes, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
- **Optimized** deployment processes on AWS, leveraging cloud services to create a scalable and robust solution.
- **Collaborated** with cross-functional teams to align the AI solution with business requirements and enhance user experience.
- **Integrated** an endpoint for custom questions to GPT-4o, enabling flexible queries with CV context.

## **Technical Details**  
- **Programming and Preprocessing**: Utilized Python for model development and data preprocessing.
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Implemented robust deployment pipelines using **AWS services** such as Lambda, ECR, and S3.
- **Model Performance Optimization**: Enhanced performance through **hyperparameter tuning** and the application of advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Computer Vision**: Integrated a custom [YOLOv8](https://yolov8.org) for detecting key sections in CVs.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Applied [Spacy](https://spacy.io)-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to classify and extract relevant information.
- **Advanced API Integration**: Connected **GPT-4o** with **AWS** to create a custom API endpoint for generic and custom question responses, contextualized by CV data.
- **Containerization**: Utilized **Docker** to containerize applications, streamlining development and deployment workflows.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated provisioning and management of AWS resources using **Terraform**.

## **Skills Developed** 
- **Deployment Expertise**: Gained practical experience in deploying machine learning models on cloud platforms.
- **NLP and Data Processing**: Improved understanding of NLP algorithms and production-level data processing techniques.
- **Team Collaboration**: Strengthened teamwork and problem-solving skills through active collaboration with project managers and developers.
- **Technical Versatility**: Enhanced proficiency in containerization, API development, and infrastructure automation.

## **Conclusion**
This internship equipped me with valuable skills in designing and deploying AI solutions in real-world applications. It laid a strong foundation for my career in machine learning and AI engineering, reinforcing both my technical and collaborative abilities.
